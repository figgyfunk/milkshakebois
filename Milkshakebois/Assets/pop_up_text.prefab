  text: 'That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even
    but now appear''d to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick''d
    on by a most emulate pride, Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
    For so this side of our known world esteem''d him--Did slay this Fortinbras; who
    by a seal''d compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his
    life, all those his lands Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: Against
    the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return''d To the
    inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, And
    carriage of the article design''d, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
    Shark''d up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in''t; which is no other-- As it doth well appear unto our
    state-- But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid
    lands So by his father lost: and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage
    in the land.'
